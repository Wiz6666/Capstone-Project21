# TaskManagementApp

TaskManagementApp is a Kanban-style task management application built with React and Supabase. It allows users to create, organize, and track tasks across different stages of completion.

## Features

- Kanban board with three columns: Pending, In Progress, and Completed
- Drag and drop functionality for easy task management
- Real-time updates using Supabase
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use

## Technologies Used

- React
- Supabase
- react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop functionality
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- A Supabase account and project

## Supabase Setup

Before running the application, you need to set up your Supabase project:

1. Create a new project in Supabase.

2. In the SQL Editor, create the `tasks` table with the following SQL:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE tasks (
     id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
     name TEXT NOT NULL,
     status TEXT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

3. Add the `user_id` column to the `tasks` table:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
   ```

4. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) for the `tasks` table:
   
   - Go to Authentication > Policies
   - Find the `tasks` table
   - Enable RLS on the `tasks` table
   - Click "New Policy"
   - Use the following settings:

     Policy Name: "Allow authenticated access to own tasks"
     ```sql
     CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated access to own tasks"
     ON public.tasks
     FOR ALL
     TO authenticated
     USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
     WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
     ```

   This single policy will handle SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, ensuring that authenticated users can only access and modify their own tasks.

5. Enable Email Auth in Authentication > Providers > Email.

6. (Optional) If you want to use third-party OAuth providers, configure them in Authentication > Providers.

7. In Project Settings, note your Project URL and Project API Key (anon/public). You'll need these for your application's environment variables.

After completing these steps, your Supabase backend will be set up to work with the TaskManagementApp. The table structure allows for task creation, updating, and deletion, while the RLS policy ensures that users can only access and modify their own tasks.

Remember to update your `.env` file with the Supabase URL and anon key:

```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_project_anon_key
```

This setup provides a secure foundation for your task management application, ensuring data isolation between users and proper authentication controls.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AlteredOracle/TaskManagementApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd TaskManagementApp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

3. You can now add tasks, drag them between columns, and delete them as needed.
